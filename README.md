# 100Words

if a=1, b=2, c=3 ... z=26 then how many words have a sum of 100? 

While the quest to find a complete list of all the words in the english dictionary is proving to be difficult. I have found a semi-complete list that will atleast give a starting ground for trying to find all english words that equal 100

Hence the project 100Words
